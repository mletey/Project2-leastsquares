# Project2-leastsquares
PSI 2023 Numerical Methods Course - Project 2

All answers contained in Project 2 ipynb file, which should run without any additional fuss so long as the user has WGLMakie and LinearAlgebra downloaded. 

The method used in this problem is fitting a function with a polynomial of various degree, using least squares interpolation. The error can be measured using the L2 norm.
